The European influence was exerted in three different, but inter-
related spheres: the incorporation of a growing part of the Ottoman
economy in the capitalist world system; the growing political influence
of the European great powers, which expressed itself in attempts both
to carve up the Ottoman Empire without causing a European confla-
gration and to dominate it while maintaining it as a separate political
entity and finally, the impact of European ideologies such as
nationalism, liberalism, secularism and positivism.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A separate discussion, for example, of the growth of an
industrial and commercial bourgeoisie in the Ottoman Empire and the
early republic is meaningless without reference to the disappearance of
the Armenians and the Greeks, which was caused by political and
ideological developments, not by any underlying law of economics.
